# Project Title: Password Generator

## Project Description:

- A simple command-line password generator built in Python. This tool helps you to create strong, random passwords of a specified length and is designed to be user-friendly by handling common input errors

## Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate fundamental Python concepts through a practical application. Specifically, it focuses on:

- Getting and validating the user input.
- Using pythons's `random` module for robust random data.
- String manipulation.
- Implementing basic error handling for for robust user interaction.

## How to run

To run this password generator, you need to have Python installed on your system.

1.  **Save teh code:** Save the provided Python code into a file named `password_generator.py`.
2.  **Open your terminal or command prompt.**
3.  **Navigate to the directory** where you saved your `password_generator.py` file.
4.  **Execute the script** using the following command

        ```bash
        python password_generator.py
        ```
        The script will prompt you to enter the desired password length. If you enter invalid input (e.d., text instead of number),it will prompt you again until a valid number is provided
